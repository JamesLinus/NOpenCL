This is a forked version of the https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/NOpenCL project created by Sam Harwell at Tunnel Vision Labs, LLC.

NOpenCL is a .NET wrapper for the [OpenCL](http://www.khronos.org/opencl/) library.
The short-term goal is providing an easy-to-use abstract layer which provides access
to the full capability of OpenCL without sacrificing performance.
